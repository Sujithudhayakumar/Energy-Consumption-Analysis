Steps Involved In the Project :-

Data Collection :
https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/energy-use-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-for-the-broader-public-sector

Import Data:
import the combined excel data .The Dataset spans from 2012 to 2021 and contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA on the preprocessed data using PowerBI. This step includes performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.


Create the Dashboard:
In Power BI, created a new report and added visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to represent the analyzed data. Used Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create a dashboard that effectively communicates the insights you have gained from the analysis.

This project helped me to learn new features of Power BI. -Power Query Editor -DAX Measures -Calculated Columns -Custom Tables -Tooltips

Created an energy consumption Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive overview of energy usage across different systems and devices. The dashboard utilized advanced data visualization techniques to highlight trends, anomalies and opportunities for energy conservation. Key features included interactive charts, drill-down capabilities, and data filtering options. The dashboard was designed to enable end-users to monitor and manage energy consumption efficiently, optimize energy efficiency, and reduce costs. The dashboard was praised for its user-friendly interface, high level of detail, and actionable insights, resulting in a measurable reduction in energy consumption and significant cost savings.
